### Example Code 
# - for data, sample covariance matrix, and two-level random-intercept model in Fig. 1 (with g=4)
# - for shrinkage estimate of the sample covariance matrix, and two-level random-intercept model in Fig.2, and estimates in Tab. 1 (with g=50)

# Note that the code only works for p=2 and n=2.

## (0) preparation ########################################################

# load required packages
library(lavaan) # for model estimation
library(tidyr) # for reformating LF to WF with pivot_wider()
library(ShrinkCovMat) # for shrinkage estimation 
# (code runs in ShrinkCovMat 1.4.0 which is the latest on CRAN, Feb 21st 2024)

# set random number seed to obtain example data
set.seed(4395) 


## (1) Population Characteristics #########################################

# We use the lavaan syntax to set the population models.
popModel_B <- "x1~~0.05*x1; x2~~0.05*x2; x1~~0.015*x2" # between level
popModel_W <- "x1~~0.95*x1; x2~~0.95*x2; x1~~0.285*x2" # within level
# means are zero by default

# We have two variables x1 and x2.
p <- 2
# The variances for both variables are the same at each level.
# The variance at the between level is 0.05.
# The variance at the within level is 0.95.
# Thus, the ICC=0.25.
# The correlation of the two variables is the same at both levels (.3).
# The covariances differ.
# Transform the correlation formula to get the covariances.
# corr_x1x2 = cov_x1x2 / (sd_x1 * var_x2)    
# | * (sd_x1 * sd_x2) and sd_x1 = sd_x2 thus | * var_x1
# corr_x1x2 * var_x1 = cov_x1x2

## (2) Sample Characteristics #############################################
